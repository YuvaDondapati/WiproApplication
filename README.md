This application implemeted using MVVM pattern in Kotlin including Android Architectural components and some important third party libraries such as Dagger2, Butterknife, Glide etc.

The main components in the MVVM pattern are:

The View — that informs the ViewModel about the user’s actions
The ViewModel — exposes streams of data relevant to the View
The DataModel — abstracts the data source. The ViewModel works with the DataModel to get and save the data.
